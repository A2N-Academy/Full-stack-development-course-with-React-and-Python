# Full-stack-development-course-with-React-and-Python
We begin with setting up a React environment, then adding database connectivity (NoSQL), and finally developing components to push material to our client. Finally, we will continue to improve our components and integrate plugins that are compatible with our program. It is a hands-on course in which you will begin developing real applications as soon as you finish the first lesson. The frontend and backend components of the application will be separate. JavaScript React will be used to create the frontend. Python Flask will be used to create the backend API. JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, API, Git, and VS Code are all covered in this practical full-stack web development Bootcamp.

At the end of this [Full Stack Development with React and Python course](https://www.a2nacademy.com/course/full-stack-development-course-with-react-&-python), you will learn about:

What is API and how does it function?
How to Create a React Single-Page Application
How to connect a React frontend application to a Python backend application
How to create a backend API service
Build a backend API service with Python Flask.
React Components, properties, and states are all useful.
